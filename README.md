# A simple compiler for basic mathematical expressions

Inspired by Graham Hutton's stack-based compiler for mathematical expressions in the book, "Programming in Haskell (2nd Edition)".
The idea is to contrast a direct evaluation mechanism for such expressions against separating code and data into separate stacks,
thereby simulating a more realistic compiler.

## Build and 

Note that this project is a Common Lisp system written from scratch. To load the system, run from the REPL:

```
	> (require "asdf")
	> (asdf:load-system "expr-compiler")
```

Note that this project has a dependency on [cl-algebraic-data-type](http://quickdocs.org/cl-algebraic-data-type/). If you are using 
QuickLisp, you must install it ahead of loading the system:

```
	> (ql:quickload "cl-algebraic-data-type")

```

In any case, ensure that this dependency is available (and visible) before running the project.

## Sample run
